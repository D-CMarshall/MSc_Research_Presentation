Feedback for presentation delivery below:

Dear Daniel,

Michael and I have now agreed the marks and feedback for this week's presentations. Feedback follows below. 

The presentation itself carries 20% of the marks for the module. The slides themselves are assessed separately and are also worth 20%. I will issue marks for the slides and coursework in early January. The pass mark for MSc modules is 50% for the module as a whole (averaged over the component parts).

The four mark categories for the presentation are: Timing [4], Delivery and use of supporting materials [6], Mathematical content [6], Handling of questions [4]. The mark for timing is the result of a formula: times in the range 4:30 to 5:30 score full marks, and one mark is deducted for every 30 seconds or part thereof beyond that range. So, for example, a time between 4:00 and 4:29 scores 3/4, as does a time between 5:31 and 6:00; a time from 6:01 to 6:30 scores 2/4, et cetera.

This presentation was excellent in most respects. Delivery was confident and physically dynamic, with enthusiastic body language and outstanding slides. The animations on some slides glitched slightly, but we do not regard this as a significant issue: overall the slides were of a much higher standard than is typical at mathematics research conferences and would be found impressive by experienced audiences. The animations anyway were an excellent way of illustrating the relevant points. The mathematical material was solid and appropriate, and questions were generally well handled (although a question about the range of physically allowable parameters was we think not fully answered). Time: 05:59.

Timing 3/4, delivery 6/6, content 6/6, questions 3/4. Total 18/20.
